# JellyfinStats for Tidbyt

This Pixlet applet displays Jellyfin statistics on a Tidbyt device. It provides a quick and visual overview of:

- Active playback sessions
- Media library statistics (e.g., number of movies and shows)
- Latest media entries per library
- User profile image grid

## Features

- ✅ Displays total number of movies and shows
- ✅ Animated transitions between sections
- ✅ Latest media shown per allowed library
- ✅ User avatars with profile images (up to 14)
- ✅ Configurable via Tidbyt app interface

## Configuration

The following fields are available in the app settings:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Server Address** | Your Jellyfin server URL (including protocol and port) |
| **API Key** | Your personal Jellyfin API key |
| **Latest Media Toggle** | Show the newest item from each selected library |
| **Library Keywords** | Additional comma-separated keywords to include libraries (e.g. "kids, action") |
| **Library Exclude Keywords** | Keywords to exclude libraries (e.g. "test, anime - filme") |

## Filtering Logic

- Libraries must match **allowed keywords** (predefined or user-defined).
- Libraries are excluded if their names match any **blocked keywords**.
- Only libraries with valid image assets are displayed.

## Display Order

1. Server logo and name
2. Library statistics
3. Active playback sessions
4. Latest media (if enabled)
5. User avatars (up to 14)
6. Outro with server name

## Image Fallback Strategy

For library item images:

1. If the item is an episode, use the series image.
2. Otherwise, use the item’s `PrimaryImageTag`.
3. As a last fallback, use `ParentThumbImageTag`.

## Limits

- GIF and Pixlet rendering are capped to 15 seconds of animation.
- Maximum of **3 libraries** and **14 user avatars** displayed per run.
- If there are more than 14 users, a random subset is shown.
